/**
 * This is a composite decorator that applies the proper swagger metadata for
 * file uploads while still allowing for documentation of the request.
 *
 * Swagger support for file upload requires _at least_ two extra decorators,
 * and in many cases of the server, three, as it will require the
 * `@ApiConsumes()`, `@ApiExtraModels()`, and `@ApiBody()` decorators, with a
 * rather large metadata object passed to `@ApiBody()`. Rather than re-create
 * this several times over, it was easier to make a simple, easily maintainable
 * abstraction that handles this.
 * ---
 * @param fileProperty the property of the request that should contain the file
 * @param bodyDto The Body type of the request for swagger documentation
